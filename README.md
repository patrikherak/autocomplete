# Autocomplete

This component uses Vue 3 + Vite with a composition API approach. Some parts were skipped due to the time limitation (e2e, unit tests) and linting could be also a bit broken due to the current Angularish VS setup on my machine.

Possible improvements with more time:
- Unit tests
- E2E tests
- Type every part of the code (mainly composables) to TS
